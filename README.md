# mnist-experiment: A Flower / PyTorch app

## Install dependencies and project

The dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` and you can install them as follows:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **Tip:** Your `pyproject.toml` file can define more than just the dependencies of your Flower app. You can also use it to specify hyperparameters for your runs and control which Flower Runtime is used. By default, it uses the Simulation Runtime, but you can switch to the Deployment Runtime when needed.
> Learn more in the [TOML configuration guide](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-configure-pyproject-toml.html).

## Run with the Simulation Engine

In the `mnist-experiment` directory, use `flwr run` to run a local simulation:

```bash
flwr run .
```

Refer to the [How to Run Simulations](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) guide in the documentation for advice on how to optimize your simulations.
